# Game-of-Life-Elm

## Intro
This is a simple Game of Life clone written in Elm.
This was written with the purpose of showing how problems can be solved in a concise way when using the Elm Architecture

## Setup
This was written in Elm 0.15, and will not work in later versions, therefore, you must install this version of Elm.
Once the Elm core is installed, "gameoflife.elm" can either be compiled or ran through elm-reactor

## Sample
The game board starts off as a [Gosper Glider Gun](http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/Gosper_glider_gun)
